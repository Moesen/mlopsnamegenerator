reflect the truth, according to common lore.

the patterns on its body."

human sweat."

look like it’s crying—apparently an effective way
of getting enemies to let down their guard."
438,bonsly,"If its body gets too damp, it will die. So, in a
process reminiscent of sweating, its eyes
expel moisture."
438,bonsly,"It expels both sweat and tears from its eyes.
The sweat is a little salty, while the tears have
a slight bitterness."
438,bonsly,"This Pokémon lives in dry, rocky areas. As its

effort into copying the graceful dance steps
of Mr. Rime as practice."

and carefully copies the Mr. Rime’s steps
like an apprentice."

it searches out round white stones."
440,happiny,"Usually it’s a well-behaved Pokémon, but if you
take its round rock away, it will cry and fuss
and throw a big old tantrum."
440,happiny,"When it sees something round and white,
Happiny puts it into the pouch on its stomach. It

shaped stone in its belly pouch. Happiny will
treasure this stone."

every day. As far as flavor is concerned,

when it’s eating a good dream, and black when
it’s eating a nightmare."

grump when freshly roused from sleep."

direction of sounds it hears, but if the sounds
cease, it panics and topples over."
524,roggenrola,"The hexagonal hole is its ear. Deep in that ear is
an energy core, so if you stick your hand in
there, Roggenrola will be very angry!"
524,roggenrola,"It was found in a fissure in a layer of exposed
rock. The material that makes up its body is
dirt from several hundred years ago."
524,roggenrola,"It’s as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in
water will cause it to soften a bit."
524,roggenrola,"When it detects a noise, it starts to move.
The energy core inside it makes this Pokémon
slightly warm to the touch."
525,boldore,"When it overflows with power,
the orange crystal on its body glows.
It looks for underground water in caves."

turned into orange crystals that are hard
enough to smash diamonds."

wary. It’s about to fire off bursts of energy."

vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever
changing the direction it’s facing."

is a popular partner for construction workers."
526,gigalith,"When it fires off energy with all its might, the
power creates countless fissures on its body."

energy. It’s usually lurking deep beneath
the surface."
526,gigalith,"This hardy Pokémon can often be found on
construction sites and in mines, working
alongside people and Copperajah."
526,gigalith,"Although its energy blasts can blow away
a dump truck, they have a limitation—

apparently led some regions to consider
Swoobat a symbol of good luck."

the group."

to the limit can cleave the ocean itself."

But if the wind gusts up, it’ll blow the cotton on
this Pokémon’s head clean off."
547,whimsicott,"This nuisance sneaks into people’s homes,
where it hides important things and scatters
cotton all over the place."
547,whimsicott,"Whimsicott doesn’t live in a fixed location. It
floats around on whirling winds, appearing all
over the place to perform its mischief."
547,whimsicott,"It scatters cotton all over the place as a prank. If
it gets wet, it’ll become too heavy to move and
have no choice but to answer for its mischief."

cotton keeps growing. If too much cotton fluff
builds up, Whimsicott tears it off and scatters it."

them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor

environment they live in turns bad, the whole
bunch will up and move to a new area."

Boiling leaves from this Pokémon’s head results in
a liquid that’s sometimes used as a bug repellent."

healthier the Pokémon is. Petilil sometimes makes
its home in a well-tended field or flowerbed."

raising it, its flowers are the most beautiful
when they bloom in the wild."

the beautiful flower on its head darkens,
droops, and withers away."
549,lilligant,"The fragrance of its flower differs slightly
depending on the soil where it grew up.
Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind."

beauty. The flower on its head needs constant
care, or it will soon wither and rot."
549,lilligant,"It’s believed that even first-rate gardeners have a
hard time getting the flower on a Lilligant’s head
to bloom."
549,lilligant,"Essential oils made from Lilligant flowers
have a sublime scent, but they’re also
staggeringly expensive."

the hook. And there are always more to catch—
many people release them into lakes illicitly."

table. The meat of red-striped Basculin is on the
fatty side, and it’s more popular with the youth."

swimming. This wise behavior keeps its enemies
from finding it and maintains its temperature."
551,sandile,"It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down
on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over
it. Its favorite food is Trapinch."
551,sandile,"Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a
comfortable environment for this Pokémon.
Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts."
551,sandile,"Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly
eats things that have collapsed in the desert.
It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.”"
551,sandile,"The desert gets cold at night, so when the sun
sets, this Pokémon burrows deep into the sand
and sleeps until sunrise."

eyes, it can see its surroundings clearly, even in
the middle of the night."

more than 30 miles away, even in the midst of
a sandstorm."

it twists its body around to rip its prey in half."

30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it
were water, then jumps out and chomps them."

whip up and waits patiently for prey to appear."

the patience to stay hidden under sand for days,
lying in wait for prey."

the natural enemy of Roggenrola and Rolycoly."
557,dwebble,"It first tries to find a rock to live in, but if there
are no suitable rocks to be found, Dwebble may
move in to the ports of a Hippowdon."

no one is safe from the reckless headbutts of this
troublesome Pokémon."

Sigilyph fly. The ruins of what may have been

glide down from tall treetops to snag its prey."
566,archen,"Once thought to be the ancestor of all bird
Pokémon, some of the latest research suggests
that may not be the case."

so if anyone other than an experienced
professional tries to restore it, they will fail."
567,archeops,"Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, the
muscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak,
so it needs a long runway in order to take off."

wants to fly, it first needs to run nearly 25 mph,
building speed over a course of about 2.5 miles."

come drooling."
568,trubbish,"If a young Pokémon or child breathes in the
toxic gas that Trubbish belches out, it could be
a life-threatening situation."

right arm. If even a little of it gets on you, you’ll
experience the effects of the unidentified toxin."
569,garbodor,"For a time, their numbers increased explosively
in Alola. Since the arrival of Grimer, their
population has decreased dramatically."
569,garbodor,"It locks opponents in place with its left hand,
immobilizing them by entirely dousing their
bodies with poisonous liquid."
569,garbodor,"Some say the reason Garbodor in Alola are a
little stronger than their counterparts elsewhere
is the presence of Muk, their natural enemy."
569,garbodor,"This Pokémon eats trash, which turns into poison
inside its body. The main component of the
poison depends on what sort of trash was eaten."

indiscriminately, turning the whole town around
it into a mountain of rubble."

seaweed. When other Pokémon come to feast on
the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead."

profile until they grow back. The meat of its
claws is so delicious!"

pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s
terrible at swimming straight."

they’ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is
popular as a delicacy in Galar."

claw, this Pokémon launches water like a bullet.
This is how Clauncher defeats its enemies."

water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls."

the Galar region, treasure came with them."
695,heliolisk,"One Heliolisk basking in the sun with its frill
outspread is all it would take to produce enough
electricity to power a city."

expected to live long because of the heat of the
current environment."

attacks slide right off."

horns. The strikes land 100 times harder than any
blow from a heavyweight boxer."

apparently only likes master keys."

that make up its diet became scarcer, Klefki
began appearing in human settlements."

Entrust a Klefki with important keys, and the

714,noibat,"After nightfall, they emerge from the caves they
nest in during the day. Using their ultrasonic
waves, they go on the hunt for ripened fruit."
714,noibat,"No wavelength of sound is beyond Noibat’s
ability to produce. The ultrasonic waves it
generates can overcome much larger Pokémon."
715,noivern,"They fly around on moonless nights
and attack careless prey. Nothing can
beat them in a battle in the dark."
715,noivern,"The ultrasonic waves it emits from its ears
can reduce a large boulder to pebbles.
It swoops out of the dark to attack."

and attack careless prey. Nothing can
beat them in a battle in the dark."
715,noivern,"The ultrasonic waves it emits from its ears
can reduce a large boulder to pebbles.
It swoops out of the dark to attack."
715,noivern,"Although it has a violent disposition, if you give
it a nice ripe fruit that it loves, Noivern will
suddenly become tame."
715,noivern,"This hot-blooded Pokémon attacks anything it
sees with ultrasonic waves that can
crush boulders."
715,noivern,"Aggressive and cruel, this Pokémon will ruthlessly
torment enemies that are helpless in the dark."
715,noivern,"Flying through the darkness, it weakens enemies
with ultrasonic waves that could crush stone.
Its fangs finish the fight."
716,xerneas,"Legends say it can share eternal life.
It slept for a thousand years in the form
of a tree before its revival."
716,xerneas,"When the horns on its head shine
in seven colors, it is said to be
sharing everlasting life."

717,yveltal,"When this legendary Pokémon’s wings and
tail feathers spread wide and glow red,
it absorbs the life force of living creatures."
717,yveltal,"When its life comes to an end, it absorbs
the life energy of every living thing
and turns into a cocoon once more."

it absorbs the life force of living creatures."

718,zygarde,"When the Kalos region’s ecosystem falls into
disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power."
718,zygarde,"It’s hypothesized that it’s monitoring
those who destroy the ecosystem
from deep in the cave where it lives."
718,zygarde,"When the Kalos region’s ecosystem falls into
disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power."
718,zygarde,"It’s hypothesized that it’s monitoring
those who destroy the ecosystem
from deep in the cave where it lives."
718,zygarde,"This is Zygarde’s form when it has gathered
50% of its cells. It wipes out all those who
oppose it, showing not a shred of mercy."
718,zygarde,"It’s thought to be monitoring the ecosystem.
There are rumors that even greater power lies
hidden within it."
718,zygarde,"This is Zygarde’s form when about half of its
pieces have been assembled. It plays the role of
monitoring the ecosystem."
718,zygarde,"Some say it can change to an even more
powerful form when battling those who threaten
the ecosystem."
719,diancie,"A sudden transformation of Carbink,
its pink, glimmering body is said to be
the loveliest sight in the whole world."
719,diancie,"It can instantly create many diamonds
by compressing the carbon in the air
between its hands."

720,hoopa,"This troublemaker sends anything
and everything to faraway places
using its loop, which can warp space."
720,hoopa,"It gathers things it likes and passes them through
its loop to teleport them to a secret place."
720,hoopa,"In its true form, it possess a huge amount of power.
Legends of its avarice tell how it once carried off
an entire castle to gain the treasure hidden within."

with its six rings and six huge arms. With its power
sealed, it is transformed into a much smaller form."

the dense fog. It’s said to live in mountains
where humans do not tread."
721,volcanion,"It expels its internal steam from the
arms on its back. It has enough
power to blow away a mountain."

arms on its back. It has enough
power to blow away a mountain."
722,rowlet,"This wary Pokémon uses photosynthesis to
store up energy during the day, while becoming
active at night."
722,rowlet,"Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before
they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with
vicious kicks."
722,rowlet,"It sends its feathers, which are as sharp as
blades, flying in attack. Its legs are strong,
so its kicks are also formidable."
722,rowlet,"It feels relaxed in tight, dark places and has
been known to use its Trainer’s pocket or bag
as a nest."
722,rowlet,"At a distance, it launches its sharp feathers while
flying about. If the enemy gets too close, Rowlet
switches tactics and delivers vicious kicks."
722,rowlet,"During the day, it builds up energy via
photosynthesis. At night, it flies silently
through the sky, on the prowl for prey."
723,dartrix,"A bit of a dandy, it spends its free time
preening its wings. Its preoccupation with any
dirt on its plumage can leave it unable to battle."
723,dartrix,"It throws sharp feathers called blade quills
at enemies or prey. It seldom misses."
723,dartrix,"This narcissistic Pokémon is a clean freak.
If you don’t groom it diligently, it will stop
listening to you."
723,dartrix,"Supremely sensitive to the presence of others,
it can detect opponents standing behind it,
flinging its sharp feathers to take them out."
723,dartrix,"It throws one knifelike feather after another at its
enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak
point. These feathers are known as blade quills."
723,dartrix,"It never slacks when it comes to the task of
cleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it
looking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp."
724,decidueye,"It fires arrow quills from its wings with such
precision, they can pierce a pebble at distances
over a hundred yards."
724,decidueye,"Although basically cool and cautious, when it’s
caught by surprise, it’s seized by panic."
724,decidueye,"It nocks its arrow quills and shoots them at
opponents. When it simply can’t afford to miss,
it tugs the vine on its head to improve its focus."
724,decidueye,"Decidueye can nock and fire an arrow at an
enemy in a tenth of a second, so its battles are
decided in the blink of an eye."
724,decidueye,"As if wielding a bow, it launches the arrow quills
hidden among the feathers of its wings.
Decidueye’s shots never miss."
724,decidueye,"In a tenth of a second, it can nock and fire an
arrow quill, piercing an opponent’s weak point
before they notice what’s happening."
725,litten,"While grooming itself, it builds up fur inside its
stomach. It sets the fur alight and spews fiery
attacks, which change based on how it coughs."
725,litten,"It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen.
Earning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude."
725,litten,"If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t
open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving
it too much affection is still a no-no."
725,litten,"Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time
comes, Litten sets its own body on fire and
burns away the old fur."
725,litten,"It spends even the smallest amount of downtime
grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers
in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves."
725,litten,"Trying to pet Litten before it trusts you will
result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws.
Be careful."
726,torracat,"At its throat, it bears a bell of fire. The bell rings
brightly whenever this Pokémon spits fire."
726,torracat,"It boasts powerful front legs. With a single
punch, it can bend an iron bar right over."
726,torracat,"It can act spoiled if it grows close to its Trainer.
A powerful Pokémon, its sharp claws can leave
its Trainer’s whole body covered in scratches."
726,torracat,"When its mane is standing on end, you can tell
it’s feeling good. When it isn’t feeling well, its fur
will lie down flat."
726,torracat,"In the midst of battle, the fire pouch on
Torracat’s neck rings like a bell and produces
stronger flames than usual."
726,torracat,"When facing a powerful enemy, Torracat’s
fighting spirit gets pumped up, and its fire bell
blazes hotter."
727,incineroar,"This Pokémon has a violent, selfish disposition.
If it’s not in the mood to listen, it will ignore its
Trainer’s orders with complete nonchalance."
727,incineroar,"After hurling ferocious punches and flinging
furious kicks, it finishes opponents off by
spewing fire from around its navel."
727,incineroar,"Although it’s rough mannered and egotistical, it
finds beating down unworthy opponents boring.
It gets motivated for stronger opponents."
727,incineroar,"When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames
around its waist become especially intense."
727,incineroar,"It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles.
The temperature of the flames that issue from its
navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit."
727,incineroar,"Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its
most notable trait, but the way it helps out small
Pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well."
728,popplio,"This Pokémon snorts body fluids from its nose,
blowing balloons to smash into its foes.
It’s famous for being a hard worker."
728,popplio,"This Pokémon can control water bubbles. It
practices diligently so it can learn to make
big bubbles."
728,popplio,"The balloons it inflates with its nose grow
larger and larger as it practices day by day."
728,popplio,"Popplio gets on top of its bouncy water balloons
to jump higher. It’s quite the acrobatic fighter!"
728,popplio,"It creates special bouncy balloons to send at its
opponents. When the balloons pop, the sheer
force of their bursting is what deals damage."
728,popplio,"If Popplio want to create big, powerful balloons,
they must be persistent. It takes daily practice for
these Pokémon to develop their skills."
729,brionne,"A skillful dancer, it creates a sequence of water
balloons as it dances, and briskly bombards
its enemies."
729,brionne,"It cares deeply for its companions. When its
Trainer is feeling down, it performs a cheery
dance to try and help."
729,brionne,"It gets excited when it sees a dance it doesn’t
know. This hard worker practices diligently until
it can learn that dance."
729,brionne,"It attacks by smacking its enemies with the
exploding water balloons that it creates."
729,brionne,"As if dancing, it artfully dodges the attacks of its
enemies. All the while, it’s busy forming a bunch
of balloons to overwhelm its foes."
729,brionne,"On nights when the sea is calm, Brionne dance
with one another to the singing of the Primarina
that’s leading them."
730,primarina,"It controls its water balloons with song. The
melody is learned from others of its kind and is
passed down from one generation to the next."
730,primarina,"Its singing voice is its chief weapon in battle.
This Pokémon’s Trainer must prioritize the daily
maintenance of its throat at all costs."
730,primarina,"To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes
down its prey with beautiful singing
and dancing."
730,primarina,"Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical
look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony
in song."
730,primarina,"With its mouth, it makes sonic waves that sound
like beautiful singing. It uses the sonic waves to
control its water balloons."
730,primarina,"For Primarina, every battle’s a stage. Its singing
and the dancing of its balloons will mesmerize
the audience."
731,pikipek,"It can peck at a rate of 16 times a second to
drill holes in trees. It uses the holes for food
storage and for nesting."
731,pikipek,"This Pokémon feeds on berries, whose leftover
seeds become the ammunition for the attacks it
fires off from its mouth."
731,pikipek,"It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can
get some idea of its mood or condition from the
rhythm of its pecking."
731,pikipek,"It may look spindly, but its neck muscles are
heavy-duty. It can peck at a tree 16 times
per second!"
732,trumbeak,"It eats berries and stores their seeds in its
beak. When it encounters enemies or prey,
it fires off all the seeds in a burst."
732,trumbeak,"By bending its beak, it can produce a variety of
calls and brand itself a noisy nuisance for
its neighbors."
732,trumbeak,"It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over
a hundred different cries at will."
732,trumbeak,"From its mouth, it fires the seeds of berries
it has eaten. The scattered seeds give rise
to new plants."
733,toucannon,"When it battles, its beak heats up. The
temperature can easily exceed 212 degrees
Fahrenheit, causing severe burns when it hits."
733,toucannon,"Within its beak, its internal gas ignites,
explosively launching seeds with enough power
to pulverize boulders."
733,toucannon,"They smack beaks with others of their kind to
communicate. The strength and number of hits
tell each other how they feel."
733,toucannon,"Known for forming harmonious couples, this
Pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a
good luck charm."
734,yungoos,"With its sharp fangs, it will bite anything.
It did not originally live in Alola but was
imported from another region."
734,yungoos,"It wanders around in a never-ending search for
food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and
falls asleep on the spot."
734,yungoos,"Its stomach takes up most of its long torso.
It’s a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to
spend on its food is no laughing matter."
734,yungoos,"Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh
living things, so it marches down streets
in search of prey."
735,gumshoos,"When it finds a trace of its prey, it patiently
stakes out the location...but it’s always snoozing
by nightfall."
735,gumshoos,"It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner,
but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them.
This Pokémon boasts incredible patience."
735,gumshoos,"Although it wasn’t originally found in Alola, this
Pokémon was brought over a long time ago
when there was a huge Rattata outbreak."
735,gumshoos,"Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of
itself and pounces when it spots its favorite
meal—Rattata!"
736,grubbin,"Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and
slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground."
736,grubbin,"They often gather near places frequented by
electric Pokémon in order to avoid being
attacked by bird Pokémon."
736,grubbin,"If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your
hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an
irritated Grubbin."
736,grubbin,"It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in
their tracks, and then it grabs them in its
sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down."
736,grubbin,"Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may
flee rather than risk getting caught in its large
mandibles that can snap thick tree branches."
736,grubbin,"It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest
floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap."
737,charjabug,"Its body is capable of storing electricity. On
camping trips, people are grateful to have
one around."
737,charjabug,"From the food it digests, it generates electricity,
and it stores this energy in its electric sac."
737,charjabug,"It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely
moves, munching away on humus. If you
accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!"
737,charjabug,"Its stout shell provides excellent defense from
attacks. It uses electricity on
persistent opponents."
737,charjabug,"While its durable shell protects it from attacks,
Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of
electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws."
737,charjabug,"Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats
into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores
the electricity for later use."
738,vikavolt,"It zips around, on sharp lookout for an opening.
It concentrates electrical energy within its large
jaws and uses it to zap its enemies."
738,vikavolt,"It produces electricity via an electrical organ in
its abdomen. It overwhelms bird Pokémon with
shocking beams of electrical energy."
738,vikavolt,"It has an organ that generates electricity in its
abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong
jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity."
738,vikavolt,"Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic
flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for
it to deliver an electric beam attack."
738,vikavolt,"It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it
through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off
in concentrated beams."
738,vikavolt,"If it carries a Charjabug to use as a spare battery,
a flying Vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered
beams of electricity."
739,crabrawler,"While guarding its weak points with its pincers,
it looks for an opening and unleashes punches.
When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints."
739,crabrawler,"It punches so much, its pincers often come off
from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What
little meat they contain is rich and delicious."
739,crabrawler,"Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense
and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler
are like boxing matches."
739,crabrawler,"Crabrawler has been known to mistake
Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The
enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it."
740,crabominable,"It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up
on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure
the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur."
740,crabominable,"It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times
of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers
and fire them like rockets."
740,crabominable,"It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its
foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice
to bits!"
740,crabominable,"Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling.
There are records of its turning back
avalanches with a flurry of punches."
741,oricorio,"It beats its wings together to create fire.
As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance,
it bathes opponents in intense flames."
741,oricorio,"This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its
passionate dance moves cause its enemies
to combust in both body and mind."
741,oricorio,"It wins the hearts of its enemies with its
passionate dancing and then uses the opening
it creates to burn them up with blazing flames."
741,oricorio,"This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer
gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon
becomes fiercely angry."
742,cutiefly,"It feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers.
Because it’s able to sense auras, it can identify
which flowers are about to bloom."
742,cutiefly,"Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of
people who have auras resembling those
of flowers."
742,cutiefly,"Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields
of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with
Butterfree over food."
742,cutiefly,"Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It
skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes’
movements and make fools of them."
742,cutiefly,"Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can
find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying
to get some of Gossifleur’s pollen."
742,cutiefly,"An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that
opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can
glide around the attack and strike back."
743,ribombee,"It rolls up pollen into puffs. It makes many
different varieties, some used as food and
others used in battle."
743,ribombee,"Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly
nutritious. They are sometimes sold
as supplements."
743,ribombee,"Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates
rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a
hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still."
743,ribombee,"It can predict the weather from moisture levels
and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself
when there are a few clear days in a row."
743,ribombee,"It makes pollen puffs from pollen and nectar.
The puffs’ effects depend on the type of
ingredients and how much of each one is used."
743,ribombee,"Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or
rained on. In the cloudy Galar region,
they are very seldom seen."
744,rockruff,"It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for
beginners because of its friendliness, but its
disposition grows rougher as it grows up."
744,rockruff,"This Pokémon has lived with people since times
long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the
dumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side."
744,rockruff,"As they develop, their disposition grows more
violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them
too much to handle and abandon them."
744,rockruff,"When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you,
that’s proof of its love for you. However, the
rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!"
744,rockruff,"This Pokémon can bond very strongly with its
Trainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising
a Rockruff for a long time can be challenging."
744,rockruff,"This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking
the ground with the rocks on its neck. The
moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks."
745,lycanroc,"Its quick movements confuse its enemies.
Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses
the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons."
745,lycanroc,"When properly raised from a young age, it will
become a trustworthy partner that will
absolutely never betray its Trainer."
745,lycanroc,"The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives.
Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees
before finishing them off."
745,lycanroc,"The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife.
Fragments that break off are treasured as
good luck charms."
745,lycanroc,"This Lycanroc is calm and cautious. The rocks
jutting from its mane are razor sharp."
745,lycanroc,"With swift movements, this Pokémon gradually
backs its prey into a corner. Lycanroc’s fangs are
always aimed toward opponents’ weak spots."
746,wishiwashi,"When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin
to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades,
and they stand together against their enemies."
746,wishiwashi,"It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone
is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone
trying to bully it receives a painful lesson."
746,wishiwashi,"They’re weak, so they move in schools.
However, they can also often be seen all alone,
having strayed from the school."
746,wishiwashi,"When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract
others of its kind. The light from its eyes is
visible almost 25 miles away."
746,wishiwashi,"Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by
gathering up into schools that they’re able
to confront opponents."
746,wishiwashi,"When it senses danger, its eyes tear up.
The sparkle of its tears signals other
Wishiwashi to gather."
747,mareanie,"It plunges the poison spike on its head into its
prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie
deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles."
747,mareanie,"It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors.
The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as
good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon."
747,mareanie,"They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are
hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola
branches that have naturally fallen off."
747,mareanie,"Aside from its head, its body parts
regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a
good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal."
747,mareanie,"The first symptom of its sting is numbness.
The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s
impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin."
747,mareanie,"Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie
of the Galar region have not yet figured out
that the branches of Corsola are delicious."
748,toxapex,"Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its
12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits
scattered in its wake."
748,toxapex,"Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer
intense pain for three days and three nights.
Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects."
748,toxapex,"To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes
flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get
mown down by the claws on its feet."
748,toxapex,"With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter
within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect
Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable."
748,toxapex,"To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this
Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing
its body so it can capture its own body heat."
748,toxapex,"Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so
toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still
be suffering three days after it first takes effect."
749,mudbray,"The mud stuck to Mudbray’s hooves enhances
its grip and its powerful running gait."
749,mudbray,"It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition.
Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire
all form part of its daily routine."
749,mudbray,"It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered
with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed
out and stops listening to its Trainer."
749,mudbray,"Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be
loaded with 50 times its own body weight
and will be totally fine."
749,mudbray,"Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its
own body weight pose no issue for this Pokémon.
It’s skilled at making use of mud."
749,mudbray,"It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all
over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk
on rough terrain without slipping."
750,mudsdale,"It spits a mud that provides resistance to both
wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were
often coated with it."
750,mudsdale,"Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best
means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks
to scrap without breaking a sweat."
750,mudsdale,"It remains calm and unmoving no matter the
situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its
mouth to make a special kind of mud."
750,mudsdale,"It can trudge mountain roads without rest
for three days and three nights, all the while
dragging a 10-ton load."
750,mudsdale,"Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs
sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows
this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick."
750,mudsdale,"Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry
over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest
or sleep."
751,dewpider,"It crawls onto the land in search of food.
Its water bubble allows it to breathe and
protects its soft head."
751,dewpider,"When it comes across enemies or potential prey,
this Pokémon smashes its
water-bubble-covered head into them."
751,dewpider,"When two Dewpider meet, they display their
water bubbles to each other. Then the one with
the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way."
751,dewpider,"It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in
water, so it wears a water bubble on its head
when it walks around on land."
751,dewpider,"It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body
and then covers its head with it. Meeting another
Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes."
751,dewpider,"Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it
comes onto land in search of food, it takes
water with it in the form of a bubble on its head."
752,araquanid,"It delivers headbutts with the water bubble
on its head. Small Pokémon get sucked into
the bubble, where they drown."
752,araquanid,"Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares
for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak Pokémon,
it protectively brings them into its water bubble."
752,araquanid,"It usually passes its time in the water. When its
belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the
water bubble on its head."
752,araquanid,"It has a habit of storing things it values in its
water bubble. If its Trainer doesn’t watch out,
Araquanid will try to put them in its bubble!"
752,araquanid,"It launches water bubbles with its legs, drowning
prey within the bubbles. This Pokémon can then
take its time to savor its meal."
752,araquanid,"It acts as a caretaker for Dewpider, putting them
inside its bubble and letting them eat any
leftover food."
753,fomantis,"During the day, it sleeps and soaks up light.
When night falls, it walks around looking
for a safer place to sleep."
753,fomantis,"They give off a sweet and refreshing scent.
Cutiefly often gather near the tall grass where
Fomantis are hiding."
753,fomantis,"When the sun rises, Fomantis spreads its four
leaves and bathes in the sunlight. The tip of its
head has a pleasant aroma."
753,fomantis,"It loves the sunshine. When it basks in the
sunlight regularly, it grows up with
vivid coloration."
753,fomantis,"When bathed in sunlight, this Pokémon emits a
pleasantly sweet scent, which causes bug
Pokémon to gather around it."
753,fomantis,"During the day, Fomantis basks in sunlight and
sleeps peacefully. It wakes and moves around
at night."
754,lurantis,"It requires a lot of effort to maintain Lurantis’s
vivid coloring, but some collectors enjoy this
work and treat it as their hobby."
754,lurantis,"It fires beams from its sickle-shaped petals.
These beams are powerful enough to cleave
through thick metal plates."
754,lurantis,"For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug
Pokémon. Both of its arms bear
keen-edged petals."
754,lurantis,"As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it’s
dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some
to call it the most glamorous Grass Pokémon."
754,lurantis,"This Pokémon resembles a beautiful flower.
A properly raised Lurantis will have gorgeous,
brilliant colors."
754,lurantis,"The petals on this Pokémon’s arms are thin and
super sharp, and they can fire laser beams if
Lurantis gathers light first."
755,morelull,"It scatters spores that flicker and glow. Anyone
seeing these lights falls into a deep slumber."
755,morelull,"As it drowses the day away, it nourishes itself
by sucking from tree roots. It wakens at the fall
of night, wandering off in search of a new tree."
755,morelull,"It scatters its shining spores around itself.
Even though they’re dangerous, nighttime tours
of forests where Morelull live are popular."
755,morelull,"It likes damp dark places. When night falls, the
spores filling the caps of its mushrooms glow."
755,morelull,"Pokémon living in the forest eat the
delicious caps on Morelull’s head.
The caps regrow overnight."
755,morelull,"Morelull live in forests that stay dark even
during the day. They scatter flickering spores
that put enemies to sleep."
756,shiinotic,"Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to
enter at night. People confused by its strange
lights can never find their way home again."
756,shiinotic,"It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness.
When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon
feeds on them by sucking in their energy."
756,shiinotic,"It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their
vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its
kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality."
756,shiinotic,"When it starts fighting for territory with
Parasect, the entire area gets completely
coated in spores!"
756,shiinotic,"Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to
sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing,
it drains their vitality with its fingertips."
756,shiinotic,"If you see a light deep in a forest at night,
don’t go near. Shiinotic will make you fall
fast asleep."
757,salandit,"It burns its bodily fluids to create a poisonous
gas. When its enemies become disoriented from
inhaling the gas, it attacks them."
757,salandit,"Volcanoes or dry, craggy places are its home.
It emanates a sweet-smelling poisonous gas
that attracts bug Pokémon, then attacks them."
757,salandit,"The males will do whatever the females tell
them. They give the females most of their food.
Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve."
757,salandit,"It weakens opponents and sends them
reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn’t
deal well with Spinda, since it’s always reeling."
757,salandit,"Its venom sacs produce a fluid that this
Pokémon then heats up with the flame in its tail.
This process creates Salandit’s poisonous gas."
757,salandit,"This sneaky Pokémon will slink behind its prey
and immobilize it with poisonous gas before the
prey even realizes Salandit is there."
758,salazzle,"For some reason, only females have been found.
It creates a reverse harem of male Salandit that
it lives with."
758,salazzle,"Filled with pheromones, its poisonous gas can
be diluted to use in the production of
luscious perfumes."
758,salazzle,"Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the
Salandit it has attracted with its pheromones
to serve it."
758,salazzle,"It punishes Salandit that couldn’t bring it food
with a fierce slap of its flame-spewing palm."
758,salazzle,"Only female Salazzle exist. They emit a gas laden
with pheromones to captivate male Salandit."
758,salazzle,"The winner of competitions between Salazzle
is decided by which one has the most male
Salandit with it."
759,stufful,"Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets
angry and flails about, its arms and legs could
knock a pro wrestler sprawling."
759,stufful,"A touch from anyone except a known friend
sends it into a surging frenzy. It’s an incredibly
dangerous Pokémon."
759,stufful,"It boasts power enough to split large trees in
half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that
it uses to communicate with others of its kind."
759,stufful,"Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any
way. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with
amazing power."
759,stufful,"Its fluffy fur is a delight to pet, but carelessly
reaching out to touch this Pokémon could result
in painful retaliation."
759,stufful,"The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may
be an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is
flailing that can snap thick tree trunks."
760,bewear,"This immensely dangerous Pokémon
possesses overwhelming physical strength.
Its habitat is generally off-limits."
760,bewear,"This Pokémon has the habit of hugging its
companions. Many Trainers have left this world
after their spines were squashed by its hug."
760,bewear,"It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and
warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t
run away as fast as possible."
760,bewear,"It boasts tremendous physical strength. Many
people call it the most dangerous Pokémon in
the Alola region."
760,bewear,"Once it accepts you as a friend, it tries to show
its affection with a hug. Letting it do that is
dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones."
760,bewear,"The moves it uses to take down its prey would
make a martial artist jealous. It tucks subdued
prey under its arms to carry them to its nest."
761,bounsweet,"A delectable aroma pours from its body.
They are often swallowed whole by Toucannon
lured by that wafting deliciousness."
761,bounsweet,"Although it’s too sugary for human consumption,
Bounsweet’s sweat can be watered down into a
juice with just the right amount of sweetness."
761,bounsweet,"Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird
Pokémon are always after it, but it’s not
intelligent enough to care."
761,bounsweet,"It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird
Pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head.
It’s usually a fruitless attempt."
761,bounsweet,"Its body gives off a sweet, fruity scent that is
extremely appetizing to bird Pokémon."
761,bounsweet,"When under attack, it secretes a sweet
and delicious sweat. The scent only calls
more enemies to it."
762,steenee,"The sepals on its head developed to protect its
body. These are quite hard, so even if pecked
by bird Pokémon, this Pokémon is totally fine."
762,steenee,"This Pokémon is always bouncing around
energetically. Other Pokémon are attracted by
its lively appearance and pleasant aroma."
762,steenee,"It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays
with bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it
relentlessly, but it doesn’t care."
762,steenee,"It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its
head with abandon. They’re quite painful when
they smack you!"
762,steenee,"As it twirls like a dancer, a sweet smell spreads
out around it. Anyone who inhales the scent will
feel a surge of happiness."
762,steenee,"Any Corvisquire that pecks at this
Pokémon will be greeted with a smack from
its sepals followed by a sharp kick."
763,tsareena,"Its long, striking legs aren’t just for show but to
be used to kick with skill. In victory, it shows off
by kicking the defeated, laughing boisterously."
763,tsareena,"A Pokémon known for the beauty of its
well-shaped legs, it sometimes appears as a
mascot in advertisements for beauty salons."
763,tsareena,"A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can
knock out even kickboxing champions with a
single blow."
763,tsareena,"A Pokémon with an aggressive personality and
a mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it
kicks an opponent."
763,tsareena,"This feared Pokémon has long, slender legs and
a cruel heart. It shows no mercy as it stomps on
its opponents."
763,tsareena,"A kick from the hardened tips of this Pokémon’s
legs leaves a wound in the opponent’s body and
soul that will never heal."
764,comfey,"It attaches flowers to its highly nutritious vine.
This revitalizes the flowers, and they give off
an aromatic scent."
764,comfey,"Baths prepared with the flowers from its vine
have a relaxing effect, so this Pokémon
is a hit with many people."
764,comfey,"It stretches sticky vines out from its head and
picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it
doesn’t have any flowers, it feels uneasy."
764,comfey,"It picks flowers and sticks them to its body
with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts
from its petals has a healing effect."
764,comfey,"Comfey picks flowers with its vine and decorates
itself with them. For some reason, flowers won’t
wither once they’re attached to a Comfey."
764,comfey,"These Pokémon smell very nice. All Comfey wear
different flowers, so each of these Pokémon has
its own individual scent."
765,oranguru,"Known for its extreme intelligence, this Pokémon
will look down on inexperienced Trainers, so it’s
best suited to veteran Trainers."
765,oranguru,"Deep in the jungle, high in the lofty canopy, this
Pokémon abides. On rare occasions, it shows up
at the beach to match wits with Slowking."
765,oranguru,"It normally spends its time meditating in the
treetops. It throws Poké Balls and gives other
Pokémon orders as it pleases."
765,oranguru,"Oranguru don’t get along with each other, so
they’re always engaging in battles of wits to
decide which one is superior."
765,oranguru,"With waves of its fan—made from leaves and its
own fur—Oranguru skillfully gives instructions to
other Pokémon."
765,oranguru,"It knows the forest inside and out. If it comes
across a wounded Pokémon, Oranguru will
gather medicinal herbs to treat it."
766,passimian,"They form groups of roughly 20 individuals.
Their mutual bond is remarkable—they will never
let down a comrade."
766,passimian,"They battle with hard berries for weapons.
Their techniques are passed from the boss to
the group, generation upon generation."
766,passimian,"They use their saliva to stick leaves to their
shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong
to from the position of the leaves."
766,passimian,"Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of
its diet. The one that can throw a berry the
farthest is the boss of the troop."
766,passimian,"Displaying amazing teamwork, they follow the
orders of their boss as they all help out in the
search for their favorite berries."
766,passimian,"Passimian live in groups of about 20, with
each member performing an assigned role.
Through cooperation, the group survives."
767,wimpod,"This Pokémon is a coward. As it desperately
dashes off, the flailing of its many legs leaves a
sparkling clean path in its wake."
767,wimpod,"Its habitat varies from beaches to seabeds.
A natural scavenger, it will gleefully chow down
on anything edible, no matter how rotten."
767,wimpod,"It will pick up anything it finds on the ground.
Sometimes it finds coins, so Murkrow and
Meowth will go after it."
767,wimpod,"An astonishingly cowardly Pokémon, Wimpod
will whir its legs at high speeds to run away if
anything comes near it."
767,wimpod,"It’s nature’s cleaner—it eats anything and
everything, including garbage and rotten things.
The ground near its nest is always clean."
767,wimpod,"Wimpod gather in swarms, constantly on the
lookout for danger. They scatter the moment
they detect an enemy’s presence."
768,golisopod,"With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws,
it cleaves seawater—or even air—right in two."
768,golisopod,"It battles skillfully with its six arms, but spends
most of its time peacefully meditating in caves
deep beneath the sea."
768,golisopod,"The shell covering its body is as hard as
diamond. This Pokémon will do anything it
takes to win."
768,golisopod,"Its claws, which it can extend and retract at
will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is
sometimes accompanied by Wimpod."
768,golisopod,"It will do anything to win, taking advantage of
every opening and finishing opponents off with
the small claws on its front legs."
768,golisopod,"They live in sunken ships or in holes in the
seabed. When Golisopod and Grapploct
battle, the loser becomes the winner’s meal."
769,sandygast,"Born from a sand mound playfully built by a
child, this Pokémon embodies the grudges of
the departed."
769,sandygast,"It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its
mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of
its sand-mound body."
769,sandygast,"It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast
will get serious and fight any children who come
to take it back."
769,sandygast,"If you build sand mounds when you’re playing,
destroy them before you go home, or they
may get possessed and become Sandygast."
769,sandygast,"Grudges of the dead have possessed a mound of
sand and become a Pokémon. Sandygast is fond
of the shovel on its head."
769,sandygast,"Sandygast mainly inhabits beaches. It takes
control of anyone who puts their hand into its
mouth, forcing them to make its body bigger."
770,palossand,"Possessed people controlled by this Pokémon
transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it
evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger."
770,palossand,"Buried beneath the castle are masses of
dried-up bones from those whose vitality
it has drained."
770,palossand,"Each of its grains of sand has its own will.
Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons
away their vital essence while they’re still alive."
770,palossand,"Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt
its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying
Pokémon snatches away their vitality."
770,palossand,"Palossand is known as the Beach Nightmare. It
pulls its prey down into the sand by controlling
the sand itself, and then it sucks out their souls."
770,palossand,"This Pokémon lives on beaches, but it hates
water. Palossand can’t maintain its castle-like
shape if it gets drenched by a heavy rain."
771,pyukumuku,"It lives in shallow seas, such as areas near a
beach. It can eject its internal organs, which it
uses to engulf its prey or battle enemies."
771,pyukumuku,"These Pokémon line the beaches. The sticky
mucous that covers their bodies can be used to
soothe sunburned skin. How convenient!"
771,pyukumuku,"The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking
started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku
back into the sea after they wash onshore."
771,pyukumuku,"Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you
accidentally step on one, you’ll slip, and it will
get mad and smack you!"
771,pyukumuku,"It lives in warm, shallow waters. If it encounters a
foe, it will spit out its internal organs as a means
to punch them."
771,pyukumuku,"It’s covered in a slime that keeps its skin moist,
allowing it to stay on land for days without
drying up."
772,type-null,"The heavy control mask it wears suppresses its
intrinsic capabilities. This Pokémon has some
hidden special power."
772,type-null,"Due to the danger that this synthetic Pokémon
may go on a rampage, it wears a control mask
to restrain its power."
772,type-null,"A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific
mission, it went berserk during an experiment,
so it was cryogenically frozen."
772,type-null,"There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its
true power is sealed away beneath its
control mask."
772,type-null,"Rumor has it that the theft of top-secret research
notes led to a new instance of this Pokémon
being created in the Galar region."
772,type-null,"It was modeled after a mighty Pokémon of myth.
The mask placed upon it limits its power in order
to keep it under control."
773,silvally,"Its trust in its partner is what awakens it.
This Pokémon is capable of changing its type,
a flexibility that is well displayed in battle."
773,silvally,"Although its name was Type: Null at first, the
boy who evolved it into this form gave it the
name by which it is now known."
773,silvally,"This is its form once it has awakened and
evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is
greatly increased."
773,silvally,"Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its
will was strengthened, and it was able to
destroy its control mask."
773,silvally,"A solid bond of trust between this Pokémon and
its Trainer awakened the strength hidden within
Silvally. It can change its type at will."
773,silvally,"The final factor needed to release this
Pokémon’s true power was a strong bond
with a Trainer it trusts."
774,minior,"Originally making its home in the ozone layer,
it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing
its body grows too heavy."
774,minior,"Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This
Pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles."
774,minior,"It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes
food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run
away, it falls to the ground."
774,minior,"Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable,
the shock of falling to the ground smashes the
shell to smithereens."
775,komala,"It is born asleep, and it dies asleep. All its
movements are apparently no more than the
results of it tossing and turning in its dreams."
775,komala,"The log it holds was given to it by its parents at
birth. It has also been known to cling to the arm
of a friendly Trainer."
775,komala,"It stays asleep from the moment it’s born.
When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops
moving altogether."
775,komala,"It remains asleep from birth to death as a result
of the sedative properties of the leaves that
form its diet."
776,turtonator,"The shell on its back is chemically unstable
and explodes violently if struck. The hole in its
stomach is its weak point."
776,turtonator,"It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its
nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and
can be put to various uses."
776,turtonator,"It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other
minerals. Materials from the food it eats form
the basis of its explosive shell."
776,turtonator,"Its exploding shell poses a real danger but
is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days,
Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves."
776,turtonator,"Explosive substances coat the shell on its back.
Enemies that dare attack it will be blown away
by an immense detonation."
776,turtonator,"Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes
explosive compounds to develop in its shell.
Its droppings are also dangerously explosive."
777,togedemaru,"The spiny fur on its back is normally at rest.
When this Pokémon becomes agitated, its fur
stands on end and stabs into its attackers."
777,togedemaru,"The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods.
The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as
energy in its electric sac."
777,togedemaru,"When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur
spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily."
777,togedemaru,"Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat
limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning
strike it!"
777,togedemaru,"With the long hairs on its back, this Pokémon
takes in electricity from other electric Pokémon.
It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac."
777,togedemaru,"When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes
its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges
electricity indiscriminately."
778,mimikyu,"Its actual appearance is unknown. A scholar
who saw what was under its rag was
overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock."
778,mimikyu,"A lonely Pokémon, it conceals its terrifying
appearance beneath an old rag so it can get
closer to people and other Pokémon."
778,mimikyu,"Although it’s a quiet, lonely Pokémon, if you try
to look at what’s under its rag, it will become
agitated and resist violently."
778,mimikyu,"A gust of wind revealed what hides under this
Pokémon’s rag to a passing Trainer, who went
home and died painfully that very night."
778,mimikyu,"It wears a rag fashioned into a Pikachu costume
in an effort to look less scary. Unfortunately,
the costume only makes it creepier."
778,mimikyu,"There was a scientist who peeked under
Mimikyu’s old rag in the name of research.
The scientist died of a mysterious disease."
779,bruxish,"When it unleashes its psychic power from the
protuberance on its head, the grating sound
of grinding teeth echoes through the area."
779,bruxish,"It stuns its prey with psychokinesis and then
grinds them to mush with its strong teeth.
Even Shellder’s shell is no match for it."
779,bruxish,"It burrows beneath the sand, radiating
psychic power from the protuberance on its
head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area."
779,bruxish,"Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie’s
spikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches
up the spikes and eats them."
780,drampa,"It has a compassionate personality, but if it is
angered, it completely destroys its surroundings
with its intense breath."
780,drampa,"This Pokémon is friendly to people and loves
children most of all. It comes from deep in the
mountains to play with children it likes in town."
780,drampa,"If a child it has made friends with is bullied,
Drampa will find the bully’s house and burn it to
the ground."
780,drampa,"It appears in towns and plays with the children.
Drampa will protect kids when they’re in danger,
so their moms don’t have to worry."
780,drampa,"The mountains it calls home are nearly two miles
in height. On rare occasions, it descends to play
with the children living in the towns below."
780,drampa,"Drampa is a kind and friendly Pokémon—up until
it’s angered. When that happens, it stirs up a
gale and flattens everything around."
781,dhelmise,"Swinging its massive anchor, it can KO Wailord
in a single blow. What appears to be green
seaweed is actually its body."
781,dhelmise,"The soul of seaweed adrift in the waves became
reborn as this Pokémon. It maintains itself with
new infusions of seabed detritus and seaweed."
781,dhelmise,"It wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks
away their vitality. It only likes to go after big
prey like Wailord."
781,dhelmise,"Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch
outward for hundreds of yards. For some
reason, it gets along well with Skrelp."
781,dhelmise,"After a piece of seaweed merged with debris
from a sunken ship, it was reborn as this
ghost Pokémon."
781,dhelmise,"After lowering its anchor, it waits for its prey. It
catches large Wailord and drains their life-force."
782,jangmo-o,"It expresses its feelings by smacking
its scales. Metallic sounds echo through
the tall mountains where Jangmo-o lives."
782,jangmo-o,"They live in mountains where no trace of
humans can be detected. Jangmo-o grow
little by little as they battle one another."
782,jangmo-o,"It smacks the scales on its head against rocks
or against the ground to frighten its opponents.
It can also contact its friends with these noises."
782,jangmo-o,"It will never show an enemy its back in battle.
Ancient warriors liked Jangmo-o for its valiant
disposition and made it one of their own."
782,jangmo-o,"They learn to fight by smashing their head scales
together. The dueling strengthens both their skills
and their spirits."
782,jangmo-o,"Jangmo-o strikes its scales to communicate with
others of its kind. Its scales are actually fur that’s
become as hard as metal."
783,hakamo-o,"It leaps at its prey with a courageous shout.
Its scaly punches tear its opponents to shreds."
783,hakamo-o,"It sheds and regrows its scales on a continuous
basis. The scales become harder and sharper
each time they’re regrown."
783,hakamo-o,"It makes noise by clanging its scales together.
When the rhythm has reached its peak,
Hakamo-o attacks."
783,hakamo-o,"The scales it sheds can be molded and
processed to make pots and pans. They
conduct heat well, so they’re a popular item."
783,hakamo-o,"The scaleless, scarred parts of its body are
signs of its strength. It shows them off to
defeated opponents."
783,hakamo-o,"Before attacking its enemies, it clashes its
scales together and roars. Its sharp claws
shred the opposition."
784,kommo-o,"When it spots enemies, it threatens them by
jingling the scales on its tail. Weak opponents
will crack and flee in panic."
784,kommo-o,"Its rigid scales function as offense and defense.
In the past, its scales were processed and used
to make weapons and other commodities."

curiosity. It summons thunderclouds and stores

of Ultra Beast."

spotted running across the land at
terrific speeds."

800,necrozma,"It survives by absorbing light. After a long time
spent slumbering underground, impurities
accumulated within it, causing its body to darken."
800,necrozma,"It needs light to survive, and it goes on a
rampage seeking it out. Its laser beams will
cut anything to pieces."

so it went undiscovered for a long time."

life-form, which brings to mind an Ultra Beast."

806,blacephalon,"A UB that appeared from an Ultra Wormhole, it
causes explosions, then takes advantage of
opponents’ surprise to rob them of their vitality."

apart with them. Even if they dodge its attack,
they’ll be electrocuted by the flying sparks."

lightning, then tears them limb from limb with
its sharp claws."

opponents with its high-voltage claws."

body of molten steel."

in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its

to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon."

the sound waves produced carry revitalizing
energy to the plants and flowers in the area."

As it strikes with amazing speed, it gets

its peers."

becomes the boss of the troop. It has a gentle

gets pumped up when cheered on. But if it starts
showboating, it could put itself in a tough spot."

and this Pokémon becomes invisible as if
it were camouflaged."

from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by

opponents in a single hit, but it also may

Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to
swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey."

charges for it straightaway, leading with its
sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw."

extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant
swallows it up."

and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda’s
flesh is surprisingly tasty, too."

forward at speeds of over 100 knots before
ramming prey and spearing into them."

secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch
this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows."

to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it

them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will
voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel."

about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its
body like a whip and launches itself at enemies."
851,centiskorch,"While its burning body is already dangerous on
its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has
large and very sharp fangs."

things is to try to punch them with its tentacles.
The search for food is what brings it onto land."

when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back.
It’s about as smart as a three-year-old."

the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with
its tentacles tremendously powerful."

a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup
of tea."
854,sinistea,"The teacup in which this Pokémon makes its
home is a famous piece of antique tableware.
Many forgeries are in circulation."
855,polteageist,"This species lives in antique teapots.
Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions,
an authentic work is found."
855,polteageist,"Leaving leftover black tea unattended is asking
for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself
into it, turning the tea into a new Polteageist."

creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm
disposition, it will never warm up to you."
856,hatenna,"If this Pokémon senses a strong emotion, it
will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas
without people."
857,hattrem,"No matter who you are, if you bring strong
emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence
you violently."
857,hattrem,"Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to
get them to quiet down. One blow from those
braids would knock out a professional boxer."

headaches as a deterrent to the approach
of others."

woods. Some believe it to have the power to
make crops grow."
861,grimmsnarl,"With the hair wrapped around its body helping to
enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm

unfurl, they latch on to opponents, ensnaring
them as tentacles would."

claws that come together to form daggers
when extended."

stiff as stone if you touch it."

can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon’s
leek withers, it will retire from combat."

shown the horrific memories behind the picture
carved into it."

berries it’s decorated with cream."
869,alcremie,"When Alcremie is content, the cream it

and richer."

over fields and mountains. The temperature of its
wings is less than −290 degrees Fahrenheit."

rain, turning a vibrant green color."

ago and worked together with humans.
Their green skin is resistant to water."
879,copperajah,"These Pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have
incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush
giant rocks into powder."
880,dracozolt,"In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its
powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway
after it depleted all its plant-based food sources."
880,dracozolt,"The powerful muscles in its tail generate its
electricity. Compared to its lower body,
its upper half is entirely too small."
881,arctozolt,"The shaking of its freezing upper half is what
generates its electricity. It has a hard time
walking around."
881,arctozolt,"This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and
was able to preserve food with the ice on its
body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly."
882,dracovish,"Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator
of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was
what drove it to extinction."
882,dracovish,"Its mighty legs are capable of running at
speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon
can’t breathe unless it’s underwater."
883,arctovish,"Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its
surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey
afterward because its mouth is on top of its head."
883,arctovish,"The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but
breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go
extinct anyway."

lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that
it rusts easily."

light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility.
It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain."
885,dreepy,"After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon,
Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit
back when it was alive in prehistoric seas."

could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help
it train, it can evolve and become much stronger."

It battles alongside Dreepy and
dotes on them until they successfully evolve."

care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute
any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy."

holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches
the Dreepy like supersonic missiles."

horns eagerly look forward to being launched out
at Mach speeds."

Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister—others

its fighting spirit heightens and power wells up
from the depths of its belly."

one-hit KO. Its strategy is to leap in close to foes
and land a devastating blow with a hardened fist."
892,urshifu,"Inhabiting the mountains of a distant region, this
Pokémon races across sheer cliffs, training its legs
and refining its moves."

with others of its kind. It’s incredibly aggressive,
and the other Pokémon of the forest fear it."

of the forest grow."

It’s said that removing the rings on Regieleki’s

of creating all Galar’s electricity."

arms were once the head of an ancient dragon
Pokémon. The theory remains unproven."

energy. Regidrago is said to have the powers of
every dragon Pokémon."

the mask of ice covering its face is 100 times
harder than diamond."

one—it doesn’t use its sense of sight. Spectrier’s
kicks are said to separate soul from body."
897,spectrier,"As it dashes through the night, Spectrier absorbs
the life-force of sleeping creatures. It craves
silence and solitude."

providing healing and blessings. It reigned over
the Galar region in times of yore."

cause hearts to mend and plants to spring forth."
